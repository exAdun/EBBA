## EDA about Blood Bowl 2022

### This is an Exploratory Data Analysis about Blood Bowl 2020 Edition. 

The data was extracted in the NAF [database](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mike.sann0638.davies#!/) in early december 2022.
I used Python since it's my most comfortable programming language to work with datasets. After that, I mostly did the charts with Tableau, but there is two graphs that I did manually with matplotlib.

What I am trying to do with the study is shed some more light into the eternal debate of which team is the "best" and maybe help some new players to understand the strenghts and weaknesses of each race.
Since I'm centering the study a little bit on the dwarves and their win rate versus elven teams, you can find graphs like:

I'm open to suggestions and feedback, so enjoy your stay!
